const faqs = [
  {
    question: "Can I refinance and get cash out in Malaysia?",
    answer: "Yes, most Malaysian banks offer cash-out refinancing. You can access up to 90% of your property's current market value, minus your outstanding loan balance. For example, if your property is worth RM500,000 and you owe RM200,000, you could potentially access up to RM250,000 (RM450,000 at 90% LTV minus RM200,000 outstanding).",
  },
  {
    question: "How much cash can I take out when refinancing?",
    answer: "The maximum cash you can access depends on: (1) Your property's current market value, (2) The maximum LTV ratio (typically 90% for first/second property), (3) Your outstanding loan balance, and (4) Your income and debt service ratio. Banks will assess all factors before approving your cash-out amount.",
  },
  {
    question: "Does cash-out refinancing hurt my credit score?",
    answer: "Cash-out refinancing itself doesn't directly hurt your credit score. However, taking on more debt increases your debt-to-income ratio, which could affect future loan applications. Making timely payments on your new, larger loan can actually help maintain or improve your credit standing over time.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is the BNM 10-year rule for cash-out refinance in 2026?",
    answer: "Bank Negara Malaysia (BNM) has guidelines that limit cash-out refinance tenure to a maximum of 10 years for the cash-out portion. This means while your property loan can extend to 35 years, the cash-out component may be structured differently. Some banks implement this as a shorter repayment period for the cash-out amount, affecting your monthly payment calculations.",
  },
  {
    question: "What can I use cash-out refinance money for?",
    answer: "You can use cash-out funds for almost any purpose: home renovations and improvements, debt consolidation (paying off high-interest credit cards or personal loans), education expenses, medical emergencies, business investment, or purchasing another property. However, banks may ask about your intended use during application.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is the difference between cash out refinance and home equity loan?",
    answer: "In Malaysia, cash out refinance replaces your existing loan with a larger one and gives you the difference as cash. Home equity loans (a separate second loan) are not commonly offered by Malaysian banks. Cash out refinance is the standard method to access home equity here.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I cash out refinance if my house is fully paid?",
    answer: "Yes! If your property has no existing loan, you can get a new loan of up to 80% of the property value as cash. This is essentially a new mortgage on a fully-paid property. See our guide on refinancing a fully paid house for more details.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is the maximum cash out I can get?",
    answer: "Typically 80% of your property value for first property, 70% for second property. For a RM500,000 property with no existing loan, you could get up to RM400,000 cash. The exact amount depends on the bank, your income, and DSR ratio.",
  },
  {
    question: "How long does cash out refinance take in Malaysia?",
    answer: "The full process takes 6-10 weeks from application to disbursement. This includes bank approval (2-3 weeks), valuation (1 week), legal documentation (3-4 weeks), and disbursement.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I cash out refinance with bad credit?",
    answer: "It's difficult but possible. Banks check your CCRIS/CTOS records. If you have late payments, try banks with more flexible criteria like Hong Leong. A co-borrower with good credit may help improve your chances of approval.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is cash out refinance a good idea?",
    answer: "It depends on your purpose. Good for: renovations that increase property value, debt consolidation at lower rates, business investment. Bad for: lifestyle spending, risky investments, or if you can't afford the higher monthly payments. Always calculate the total cost over the loan term before deciding.",

                    Bank Negara Malaysia (BNM) has guidelines affecting cash-out refinance tenure.
                    Understanding this rule is crucial for planning your cash-out strategy.

                <p className="text-gray-700">
                  BNM guidelines suggest that the <strong>cash-out portion</strong> of your refinance should ideally
                  be repaid within 10 years. This doesn&apos;t mean your entire loan is limited to 10 years –
                  only the cash-out component may be structured with this shorter tenure in mind.

                  Different banks handle this differently:

                <p className="text-gray-700">
                  If the 10-year rule applies to your cash-out portion, your monthly payment may be higher
                  than expected. For example, RM200,000 cash-out at 4% over 10 years = RM2,024/month,
                  versus RM955/month if spread over 25 years.

                    Most cash-out refinances come with a new 3-5 year lock-in period.
                    Early exit means paying penalties.

                <strong>Our Advice:</strong> Cash-out refinancing makes sense when you&apos;re using the funds
                for value-adding purposes (renovations, high-interest debt payoff, or investments with returns
                above your mortgage rate) and you can comfortably afford the new monthly payment.
